  abstract = "BACKGROUND: To provide the validated and standardized form of the
              Persian version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaires as an
              appropriate developmental screening tool for evaluation of
              Iranian children's development. METHODS: This was a
              cross-sectional study. Translation and back-translation, content
              validity determination, cultural and lingual modifications, pilot
              study on 100 parents and inter-rater reliability determinations
              were performed, respectively. The national and final stage was
              carried out 11000, 4-60 month-old children in selected cities
              throughout the country in order to determine the validity,
              standard deviation, reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and
              mean scores points of the test. RESULTS: The reliability,
              determined by cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.76 to 0.86 and the
              inter-rater reliability was 0.93. The validity determined by
              factor analysis was satisfactory. The mean scores of Iranian
              children were identified and compared with those of the normative
              sample as well as with three other populations of children. The
              developmental status of Iranian children was higher in the
              communication, problem-solving and personal-social domains,
              especially under the age of 24 months, after which their
              developmental status seems to deteriorate, especially in the
              motor domains. CONCLUSION: The Persian version of the ASQ has
              appropriate validity and reliability for screening developmental
              disorders in Iran.",
